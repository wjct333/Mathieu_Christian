# Welcome to the Week 7 CodeBench exercise set. As with the Week 6 set, we start with some revision exercises, and then have some slightly longer algorithm design questions to finish.
#
# The code below defines a Person class. Each person has a name and a list of friends that other pople can be added to.
#
# You jobs are to:
#
# Implement the constructor for person so that the name given to the constructor is stored in a member variable called name and a member variable called friends is initialised to an empty list.
#
# Implement the method is_friends_with. If a and b are people then this method should return true if a has been added as a friend of b or if b has been added as a friend of a.
#
# Implement the add_friend method. If a and b are instances of Person then after a.add_friend(b) is called a must be a friend of b and b must be a friend of a.
#
# The tests at the end of the program will check whether all the above conditions are properly implemented by your code.
#
# An exercise on Classes, lecture 12.

# # Q3 Classes are a useful way of storing related data items (in much the same way that a dictionary can store key-value pairs).
